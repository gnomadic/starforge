# Jobs

Jobs are the background of progress.  We recommend always have a job active.  Every job you perform earns resources and builds skills, and those skills unlock bigger, riskier, and more rewarding work.

### Rules

1. &#x20;A planet can only have one active job at a time.
2. A job can be left running up to it's time limit, usually around a day but some jobs have shorter limits and some have longer. &#x20;
3. A Job rewards resources based on how long it's running.
4. A Job has an associated "Skill Path", and every time you complete a Job it will boost your planet's skill level.

> During the ALPHA playtest, a planet's stats and skills have no impact - This is on [the roadmap](https://github.com/users/gnomadic/projects/2/views/3), and when we introduce Artifacts and Quests those will impact Jobs as well
