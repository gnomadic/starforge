# Supplies





Supplies in STARFORGE are onchain tokens.  They are used as balance checks, and can be spent to perform various actions and unlock features. &#x20;



> During the ALPHA playtest, Supplies do not have a use yet.  They can be currently only be earned by performing Jobs.   Currently supplies are ERC20 tokens and adding support for some to be an ERC721 is on [the roadmap](https://github.com/users/gnomadic/projects/2/views/3).



### Rules

1. Supplies are stored in the wallet that holds your planet - this means that all planets will share Supplies
2. Most Supplies are trade-able but some will be walletbound.



### Youâ€™ll gather:

* **Bioflux** (`SF-BIO`): Living energy from spores and blooms. Used for greenhouses, terraforming zones, and evolving biomes.
* **Hydrocite** (`SF-HYDRO`): Frozen water laced with rare minerals. Critical for irrigation, cooling systems, and biosphere stabilization.
* **Solaris Dust** (`SF-DUST`): Nanodust that stores solar energy. Powers ancient tech, energizes drones, and maybe... opens otherworldly doors.

Supplies are earned through jobs, stored in your wallet with your planet, and used in future systems like crafting, terraforming, or story unlocks.





> the words `Resources` and `Supplies` are used interchangeably.  In the code, they are called Supplies because the word `Resource` is used by a lot of computer systems already.
