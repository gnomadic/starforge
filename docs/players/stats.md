# Stats

Every planet is discovered with a unique stat sheet.  This is a mix of environmental variables and skill potential that defines your journey.&#x20;

Stats are permanent and public. No resets and no rerolls.  As you join the fight against entropy your planet's stats can improve. &#x20;

### Rules

* Stats are organized into Stat Sets.
* Some Stat Sets are randomly generated during mint and some start at a default value.

### You'll have:

**Core Stats** (randomized at mint):

* **Temperature**
* **Water**
* **Biomass**
* **Atmosphere**
* **Density**
* **Anomaly**

These shape your planetâ€™s natural tendencies and may influence outcomes in future systems like farming, exploration, or weather events.



**Job Skills** (Start at 0):

* Organic,&#x20;
* **Lithic,**&#x20;
* **Solaric**

These skills start at zero, cap at 99.  The are boosted by performing jobs in each skill path, and higher skills unlock advanced jobs (and better rewards)
