# Hello Players

Welcome to **STARFORGE**, the first game built on top of the emerging Tavern Protocol.&#x20;

You are entering a living world at the edge of entropy, where every action moves the universe forward towards it's inevitable collapse. &#x20;

### We need you

The universe is dying. Energy is scarce. Planets are rare. You play as the caretaker of  a barely living world drifting through the remnants of a forgotten age. Rumors speak of ancient machines that can reverse entropy, but no one knows where they are... or if they’re even real.

What we do know? Life persists. And where life persists, stories unfold.

### Mint Your Planet

Your journey begins with a single action: **mint a planet**.

Each planet is unique — procedurally generated onchain with its own stats, potential, and mysteries. This planet becomes your hero, and acts as your anchor in the STARFORGE universe.



> During the ALPHA playtest, minting is completely free and you can mint as many planets as you would like.&#x20;



### Get to work

After minting, head to the **Codex** to check your planet’s stats. Then start a **Job** — simple tasks like scouting, mining, or surveying.

Each Job you complete:

* **Boosts your skills** (check _Job Skills_ in the codex)
* **Earns you resources** (the raw materials of progress)
* **Moves the story forward** (Not yet, but that's the idea)

Over time, your planet gets stronger, more capable, and more valuable.  Not just to you, but to the whole&#x20;

### What's Next?

This is just the beginning. As the protocol evolves, new Scenarios, Systems, and gameplay loops will unlock — and your early efforts will shape the world to come.

So jump in now. Claim your planet. Start working. And help us build a universe worth saving.
