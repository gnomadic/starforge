# Hello Creators

**STARFORGE** and other **Tavern Protocol** games aren't just games, they're a decentralized storytelling canvas. If you’ve got ideas, stories, mechanics, or entire ecosystems in your head, we want to help you bring them to life. There are two main ways to create content in the protocol:



### **Scenarios: Modular Game Content**

Scenarios are the foundation of all gameplay. Each Scenario defines:

* The **Jobs** players can perform
* The **Stats** that power progression
* The **Supplies** to earn and spend
* Any other content specific to a System

Scenarios are fully onchain and modular. You can write one to showcase a new mechanic, build a themed narrative, or remix existing content into something completely fresh. Think of them as the "levels", "worlds", or "stories" in the STARFORGE universe (or any Tavern Protocol game).

### **Games: Launching a Full Experience**

A Game is a wrapper around a set of Scenarios — plus a **hero NFT** that acts as the player’s avatar or vessel.

To launch a new game, you need two things:

1. A deployed **Scenario** with your desired content
2. A **hero NFT** (in STARFORGE, that’s a planet)

Once launched, a Game can evolve through additional Scenarios, updates, and community contributions — all while using the shared Systems that power the entire protocol.

### How to Get Involved

We’re building in public, and there are lots of ways to join in:

* Chat and share your ideas on [**Warpcast**](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/playtavern)
* Hang out in the [**Telegram**](https://t.me/starforge) to get updates and meet fellow creators
* Want to peek under the hood? Look at how STARFORGE [defines it's first scenario](https://github.com/gnomadic/starforge/blob/main/chain/src/scenarios/RegenScenario.sol)&#x20;



If you’re a writer, worldbuilder, designer, or dev, this is your forge. Let’s build something wild.
